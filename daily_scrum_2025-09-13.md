**Date:** 2025-09-13
**Attendees:** Mujeeb, Khoa, Jason

### Updates
**Mujeeb**
- Created a Google Slides presentation to work on the project introduction and prepare slides for presentation.
- Helped plan the specifications of the project.

**Khoa**
- Drafted the problem statement for the client: managing assignments and grades still being done on paper which could be inefficient and more prone to errors.
- Suggested the solution: an Assignment & Grading Manager app where students submit work online, instructors grade within the system and the system auto-calculates totals and stores everything in a database.

**Jason**
- Reviewed the proposed problem and solution framework.
- Agreed to the plan for the Assignment & Grading Manager app.
